Hello friends in this project I have made an arduino based Playing card dealing machine.
Playing cards with friends is very fun time to enjoy, because I am tech nerd

I thought why not to add some tech flavour to the game and made some machine which dispense the card for the player.

So in this way I got idea to build this amazing machine, 

To build this card dealing machine I have used arduino nano as a micro controller and stepper motor and DC motor 
Stepper rotate the platform and other DC gear motor will dispense the card.

I also used my custom PCB for the complete project the custom PCB is very helpful to build arduino project 
If you are interested to build your custom PCB please read complete post I will share the Gerber file of PCB and more details.



# COMPONENT USED

> Arduino Nano
> A4988 Stepper driver
> Nema 17 stepper motor
> N20 DC gear motor
> Custom PCB
> 12mm wooden sheet



# BUILD

First of all I take the measurements on 12mm wooden sheet with the help of scale and pencil. 
I approx. cut the wooden piece in size of 130mm x 130mm

Then I take a 4mm wooden sheet and draw a 100mm circle with the help of compass
Now I cut the round wooden sheet with the help of band saw machine 
Then I attached the disk to my mini lathe and give it last finishing touch with the help of sand paper
In this way I get perfect round wooden disc.

After that I 3D printed this gear type ring this will be rigidly connected with the base of machine.
the gear connected the shaft will get lock with the base ring so when stepper motor rotate the hole platform will rotate.
